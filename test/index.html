He plans to graduate in 2015 with a CS degree under a computer engineering specialization.

</p>
<p>Karthik began his endeavours in computer science and web development upon entering high school. He started a technical blog, <a href="/projects/lateral-code">Lateral Code</a>, exploring the latest web development techniques and tactics. Although the blog is now inactive, it still receives over 20,000 views per month.

</p>
<p>In his sophomore and junior years of high school, Karthik was paid to write for <a href="/publications">Smashing Magazine and Nettuts+</a>, two of the top web development blogs in the business. He continued his career with <a href="/projects">numerous freelance projects</a> using technologies ranging from WordPress to Django to NodeJS. Karthik also got involved in the computer science and robotics clubs on campus, eventually becoming the president and vice-president of the two organizations.

</p>
<p>While in his senior year, Karthik became a gold-level USA Computing Olympiad finalist, ranked in the top 25 of the nation&#39;s top algorithmic developers. He also went on to win third place in the World Series of Hack, a large bay-area hackathon consisting of over 200 attendees and 50 projects, with his entry, <a href="/projects/pigeon-carrier">Pigeon Carrier</a>.

</p>
<p>After taking his first few classes at Stanford, Karthik applied for and was offered a position as a section leader for the introductory CS classes, combining his passion for programming with his interest in teaching.

</p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, Karthik worked as a web development intern at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to their mission of bettering the web. He primarily focused on building <a href="/projects/napkin">Napkin, a rapid web prototyping tool</a> that brings interaction to wireframing.

</p>
<p>Mozilla has inspired Karthik to delve into the open-source community. As such, Karthik recently created <a href="/projects/nodefront">Nodefront</a>, an open-source front-end development utility that was featured on <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/28907543901/node-js-powered-rapid-front-end-development-utility">The Changelog</a>.

</p>
<p>Karthik has his sights set on continuing to build tools that make a difference, as he simply can&#39;t resist the joy he gets when opening <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor">vim</a> and coding a new project. Indeed, as a great physicist once said,
